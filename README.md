## Overview

**NotParx** is a comprehensive solution designed to enhance the functionality of [ParkPrescriptions.ca](https://www.parkprescriptions.ca/) developed at the request of PaRx as part of the CSCC01 course at UTSC (Introduction to Software Engineering). This project interfaces with 10 Canadian medical databases in real-time, allowing healthcare professionals to issue park prescriptions efficiently. The platform is built with scalability, availability, and ease of use in mind, offering a seamless experience for both administrators and users.

### Purpose

The primary goal of NotParx is to streamline the process of issuing park prescriptions, making it easier for healthcare professionals to encourage outdoor activities for their patients. By integrating real-time data and providing a robust interface, NotParx supports the mission of ParkPrescriptions.ca in promoting the health benefits of nature through park prescriptions.

### How It Helps ParkPrescriptions.ca

NotParx provides a dynamic interface that supports the goals of ParkPrescriptions.ca by:
- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Integrating real-time data from multiple Canadian medical databases to ensure accuracy and speed.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Utilizing cloud technologies like Azure, Azure Functions, and MongoDB Atlas to ensure scalability and availability.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Offering a user-friendly interface for coordinators, assistants, prescribers, and patients to manage prescriptions effectively.

## Demo and Live Website

[Video Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sij9cLY_qe0)

Please note that due to resource constraints, all backend and Azure-dependent functionalities are removed in the demo.

The front-end of NotParx is live and can be accessed at [NotParx Demo-Live Website](https://c01notparx.netlify.app/), but it is unlikely that you would be able to log in at this time. 

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Built with ReactJS for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Powered by Django, offering scalable microservice integration.
- **Data Integration**: Real-time data scraping using Azure Functions and Python web-scraping for over 10 Canadian medical databases.
- **Infrastructure**: Azure App Services, Azure Blob Storage, and Azure Functions. MongoDB within AWS cloud infrastructure, optimized for performance and scalability.
- **Deployment**: CI/CD using Github Actions and Azure.

  - The platform enforces strict access controls to protect sensitive information.
  - Unauthorized attempts to access restricted areas are automatically redirected to appropriate pages.

## Login Details for Demo Accounts

The following credentials were used for demo admin accounts, but are not currently available:

- **Coordinator Account**:
  - Username: `Coordinator`
  - Password: `CoordPassword`

- **Assistant Account**:
  - Username: `Assistant`
  - Password: `AssistPassword`

Prescriber and patient accounts can be created directly through the interface, so no demo account details are provided for these roles.
